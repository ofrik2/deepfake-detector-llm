# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Deepfake Video Detection using Large Language Models

---

## 1. Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a software package that determines whether a given video is REAL or AI-generated (DEEPFAKE) using Large Language Models (LLMs).

Unlike traditional deepfake detection approaches based on supervised learning and specialized classifiers, this project focuses on LLM-based reasoning guided by carefully designed prompts that analyze visual consistency and artifacts across video frames.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

AI-generated videos are becoming increasingly realistic and difficult to distinguish from real recordings. Traditional detection methods typically rely on large labeled datasets and model training, which limits flexibility and generalization.

This project explores whether a general-purpose LLM, when provided with structured visual observations and well-engineered prompts, can reliably distinguish between real human videos and synthetic or manipulated videos.

## 3. Goals and Success Criteria

### 3.1 Primary Goals
- Accept a video file as input
- Analyze visual patterns across video frames
- Use an LLM to classify the video as either REAL or DEEPFAKE
- Produce an explicit and deterministic classification result

### 3.2 Success Criteria
- Correctly identifies synthetic videos generated by the system
- Correctly identifies real, unmodified videos
- Produces consistent results across repeated runs
- Outputs results in a structured and machine-readable format

---

## 4. Non-Goals

- Training or fine-tuning machine learning models
- Pixel-level manipulation detection
- Audio-only deepfake detection
- Real-time or streaming video analysis

---

## 5. Target Users

- Researchers exploring LLM reasoning capabilities
- Students studying prompt engineering techniques
- Developers experimenting with AI-based media analysis

---

## 6. Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Input
- Video file in MP4 format
- Optional configuration parameters such as frame sampling rate or LLM provider

### 6.2 Processing
- Extract frames from the input video
- Summarize visual characteristics across frames
- Generate a structured prompt for the LLM
- Invoke the LLM for analysis
- Aggregate LLM responses into a final decision

### 6.3 Output
- Final classification: REAL or DEEPFAKE
- Optional textual explanation of detected artifacts
- Output provided in JSON or structured text format

---

## 7. Prompt Engineering Requirements

- Prompts must focus on visual consistency over time
- Prompts must avoid assumptions specific to a single video
- Prompts must encourage analytical reasoning rather than guessing
- All prompts must be versioned and logged
- Prompt changes and iterations must be documented

---

## 8. Video Generation Strategy

Two types of videos will be used for evaluation.

### 8.1 Synthetic Videos
- Generated using an OpenCV-based frame synthesis approach
- Optionally generated using external tools such as Google FLOW
- Designed to contain subtle but detectable visual artifacts

### 8.2 Real Videos
- Unmodified real recordings
- Used to validate that the system does not over-classify videos as fake

---

## 9. Evaluation Plan

The system will be evaluated based on:
- Correct classification of synthetic videos
- Correct classification of real videos
- Consistency of results across runs
- Sensitivity to changes in prompt design

Failure cases and ambiguous results will be documented and analyzed.

---

## 10. Constraints and Assumptions

- LLM access is available via an external API
- Video analysis is performed offline
- The system operates in batch mode
- Performance is not required to be real-time

---

## 11. Risks

- Overfitting prompt logic to synthetic videos
- Inconsistent or hallucinated LLM reasoning
- False positives when analyzing real videos

Mitigation strategies include prompt generalization and validation on real data.

---

## 12. Future Extensions (Out of Scope)

- Multi-LLM ensemble comparison
- Audio-visual synchronization analysis
- Real-time streaming analysis
- Graphical user interface for video upload and visualization

---

## 13. Deliverables

- Python package implementing the deepfake detection pipeline
- Prompt engineering log
- Evaluation report documenting results and limitations
- Example real and synthetic videos
